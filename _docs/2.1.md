It is important to first note that the analyst’s theoretical framework may determine what constitutes an LI violation, a point which is discussed in **Section 3.2** and again in **Section 5**). Therefore, this section has two preliminary goals, which will serve as the foundational assumptions throughout the remainder of this paper: (i) a formal, working definition of LI will be provided, and (ii) a taxonomy of violation types is introduced, along with linguistic data examples demonstrating how the definition of LI in (i) facilitates the classification of distinct violation types.  
<br/>
Assuming a strongly lexicalist position in the spirit of Bresnan and Mchombo (1995:181) and Anderson (1992:84), in addition to the ordered modularity presupposed by LI (e.g. Botha 1981:18, Borer 1998:152-153), allows one to formulate certain predictions regarding the morphology-syntax interface. These predictions are presented below, and an attempt is made to relate each with the observations on LI of Postal (1969), Booij (2005, 2009), Lieber and Scalise (2007), and Bruening (2018)<sup>[14](#fn14)</sup>:  
##### **Predictions Made by LI**  
1. Syntactic processes (e.g. movement, deletion, etc.) cannot affect a proper subpart of a word (cf. Postal’s point (ii), Booij’s ‘manipulation’, Lieber and Scalise’s category (a)).  
1. Syntactic (and semantic) interpretation rules may not see a proper subpart of a word (e.g. anaphora, semantic scope, agreement between lexical units, etc.) (cf. Postal’s point (i), Booij’s ‘accessibility’, Lieber and Scalise’s categories (a) through (c), and Bruening’s Error 2).  
1. The ordering of morphological processes relative to syntactic processes is unidirectional (e.g. morphological processes, such as derivational or inflectional affixation, conversion/zero derivation, etc.) cannot affect phrase-level constituents. In the case of weakly lexicalist approaches in which inflection, but not derivation, is determined by syntax, this predicts that inflectional markers should always occur external to derivational markers<sup>[15](#fn15)</sup> (Beard 1998:45-46) (cf. Bruening’s Error 1 and Lieber and Scalise’s category (a)).  
<br/>
The predictions made by a strongly lexicalist, modular view of LI facilitates the development of a taxonomy of apparent LI violations, provided in **Figure 1**<sup>[16](#fn16)</sup>. Since LI is explicitly concerned with negative exceptions to the principle (i.e., those violations which it correctly precludes), only positive exceptions are considered as proper violations. Corresponding to each aforementioned prediction, three general violation types are identified: MANIPULATION violations, which involve syntactic processes that are typically assumed to operate on indivisible word forms (i.e. terminal nodes) and phrasal constituents; ACCESS violations, which involve bidirectional, intermodular interaction between morphology, syntax, and semantics; and ORDER violations, which involve situations where observable linguistic forms contradict the supposed linear order of morphology and syntax. In some, if not most, cases, specific violations and their overall types can be reanalyzed in terms of an opposing perspective, as noted above regarding word-part ellipsis/suspended affixation in **Section 1.2**, **Example 7**. These points of potential reanalysis are indicated in **Figure 1** by means of the co-indexed superscript symbols †, ‡, and §<sup>[17](#fn17)</sup>.

<br/>
Furthermore, the general LI violation types MANIPULATION, ACCESS, and ORDER, each comprise at least two subtypes. For example, MANIPULATION may include instances of apparent syntactic movement into words, as in the example of Mohawk noun incorporation (Baker 1985a:38) in **Example 8** below. Baker argues that the relationship between the sentences in **8a** and **8b**, which he syntactically represents by means of the respective phrase structure trees in **Example 9a** and **9b**, is a derivational one, with **8a** functioning as the input, and syntactic (head) movement of the lexical unit *nuhs* ‘house’ onto the verb root *rakv* ‘be white’ producing the observed output in **8b**<sup>[18](#fn18)</sup>. Therefore, instances of noun incorporation and the like (e.g. Udi person markers **Example 6a** - **6c** above) are considered to be a specific subtype of MANIPULATION – particularly, movement (into and out of words).
