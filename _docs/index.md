At its core, this paper is an exploration of the morphology-syntax interface, and whether the combination of linguistic units into words and phrases should be treated as distinct grammatical components or as parts of a uniform grammatical system. Specifically, the present survey takes lexicalism – a long-held theoretical position maintained by morphologists and syntacticians for over forty-eight years (outlined in Section 1.1 and 1.2) – as the lens through which to understand not only its role in linguistic theory, but the nature of the morphology-syntax interface and goals of grammatical theory in general. By considering the predictions present formulations of lexicalism (e.g. the Lexical Integrity Principle (Bresnan and Mchombo 1995)) make regarding morphosyntactic interaction (Section 2), both cross-theoretically in Section 3 and cross-typologically in Section 4, it is shown that lexicalism does not properly characterize the morphology-syntax interface, and neither do linguistic theories based on lexicalist assumptions (Section 5).
