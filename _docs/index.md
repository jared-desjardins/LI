At its core, this paper is an exploration of the morphology-syntax interface, and whether the combination of linguistic units into words and phrases should be treated as distinct grammatical components or as parts of a uniform grammatical system. Specifically, the present survey takes lexicalism – a long-held theoretical position maintained by morphologists and syntacticians for over forty-eight years (outlined in [**Section 1.1**](http://jared-desjardins.github.io/LI/docs/1.1/) and [**1.2**](http://jared-desjardins.github.io/LI/docs/1.2/)) – as the lens through which to understand not only its role in linguistic theory, but the nature of the morphology-syntax interface and goals of grammatical theory in general. By considering the predictions present formulations of lexicalism (e.g. the Lexical Integrity Principle (Bresnan and Mchombo 1995)) make regarding morphosyntactic interaction ([**Section 2**])(http://jared-desjardins.github.io/LI/docs/2.1/), both cross-theoretically in [**Section 3**](http://jared-desjardins.github.io/LI/docs/3.2/) and cross-typologically in [**Section 4**](http://jared-desjardins.github.io/LI/docs/4.2/), it is shown that lexicalism does not properly characterize the morphology-syntax interface, and neither do linguistic theories based on lexicalist assumptions ([**Section 5**](http://jared-desjardins.github.io/LI/docs/5.1/)).
